The main page is divided into several sectors. In the first sector, you can see four buttons. If you are a first visitor, you may click ‘enroll’ button to sign-up and set your goals. Otherwise, click ‘login’ button to load your information. In the below sectors there are some basic information about our service, including functions of ‘Promiss’ or numbers of users, source code, and developers.

In the enroll page, you can sign-up easily by just typing ID, password, and E-mail, then click next button.

In the user’s page, you can see the status of your current challenge. You can easily share your challenge on SNS or go to the share page if you have done it before. Also you can see the cheering messages from your friends. If you want to allow yourself to smoke or drink alcohol, or drink coffee just for a one time, click the blue button ‘Really want to chill today?’. You will face another challenge to get the opportunity!

The shared page is the page which is shared on SNS, and anybody can visit. It also contains current state of your challenge. They can ‘report’ you when you failed to cut-off your dependency. You can honestly report yourself, too. Going down, your friends can leave you a cheering message which is shown in the user page. Below the cheering message, others can ‘poke’ you to remind your determination, and the ranking is displayed at the left. Also others can bet on your challenge, whether you will success or not. Our web does not support the actual transaction, but still your choice will be recorded in the web. The last function is the poster section; which others can post up fun image about your challenge.
